    // whereas a subclass of a sealed class can have multiple instances that can contain state
    // for better handling.

    //Like abstract classes the sealed classes allow us to represent hierarchies. Child-classes can

    //But unlike abstract classes, we need to define these hierarchies in the same file or as
    // nested classes. We cannot extend the sealed class outside the file itâ€™s defined as it gives
    // a compilation error.
